# Node.js Random Color Generator

This code creates a random color generator.

Node index.js shows a block of approximately 31x9 # characters colored with a random color (using hex code, e.g. #ff0000).

In addition to node index.js, it should also be able to accept the request for a:
hue (e.g. green or red or blue)
luminosity (e.g. light or dark)
...and then generate random colors that match those choices.
